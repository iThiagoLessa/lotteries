# Lotteries Results

This project was created to my studies, it's a frontend application that shows the results from lotteries. 

In this first part, I created the application using reactJs, direct and indirect communication.

I decided to create this application without context API to improve this code later, applying and studying more the context API.

**Atention:** this giveaway is illustrative of an api test.

## to run the application

- clone the project
- open the terminal and go to the path where you saved the project
- run the command `npm i`
- after installed all the dependencies from the project run `npm start`
